## Greetings! I'm Alecs

ðŸ’š My pronouns are: **she/they**

I post my thoughts and keep track of my published work [on my self-hosted static website](https://catileptic.tech/).

I work with [AsociaÈ›ia pentru Tehnologie È™i Internet](https://apti.ro/) (digital rights advocacy). 

I work on open-source development, tech public policy (in Romania & the EU), data wrangling and securing communications for journalists & activists. 

Things I'd love to get involved in are: Rust development and post-collapse computing.
